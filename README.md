# breathing-reset
一个喷嚏犯困后和ChatGPT网页端聊出来的呼吸引导，可以记录次数，点开即用

A tiny breathing guide for moments when your system needs a reset.

This is a single-file web app designed for:
- fatigue
- cognitive overload
- sudden drowsiness
- nervous system downshifts

No accounts.  
No data upload.  
No optimization pressure.

---

## What it does

- Guides a **4–6 breathing rhythm**  
  (inhale 4s, exhale 6s)
- Uses **soft audio cues**
- Records **completed breathing cycles locally**
- Works offline, runs entirely in the browser

One full cycle = one intentional breath.

## Why it exists

Sometimes you don’t need motivation, productivity tools, or tracking dashboards.

You just need a small, reliable way to tell your nervous system:

> “It’s okay. You can slow down now.”

---

## How to use

Open the app, press **Start**, and follow the sound.

You don’t need to look at the screen.
